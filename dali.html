							<h2>Abstract</h2>
							<p>Machine Translation (MT) for low-resource languages such as isiXhosa is challenging in specialised domains such as medicine. 
								Domain adaptation by lexicon induction (DALI) is a method for creating synthetic parallel corpora for low resource languages in a
								specific domain. This is done by word-for-word back-translating a monolingual corpus of data using a bilingual lexicon. DALI achieved 
								performance gains in adapting MT models to specific domains in the initial study introducing the technique. However, it has not 
								been tested in a truly low-resource setting such as isiXhosa medical. This project tests the efficacy of DALI generated synthetic 
								data for fine-tuning models for English-isiXhosa MT in the medical domain. The results of the experiments done indicate that 
								DALI does not improve medical domain translation for isiXhosa. For Eng→Xho translation the baseline model outperforms all the 
								fine-tuned models, while for Xho→Eng translation the fine-tuned models marginally outperform the baseline model. These models 
								were also compared to others trained by team-mates. The models fine-tuned using back-translated synthetic data significantly 
								outperformed the DALI models in both translation directions. This could be because DALI is not suitable for truly low-resource 
								languages such as isiXhosa and requires a higher quality lexicon, with a larger vocabulary to perform better. The health term error 
								rate was calculated across various categories which shows the lexicon may not be of a high enough quality, as the baseline typically 
								outperformed the fine-tuned models in all categories.</p>
